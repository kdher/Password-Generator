# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

This Homework is a password generator using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create secure passwords based on criteria. Users can choose the types of characters to include in the password as well as the length of the password by filling in the presented form. The code will check for a valid length (between 8 and 128 characters) and will validate that at least one character type has been chosen. The program then prompts the user to define if they would like to include numbers, characters, uppercase and lowercase letters. If the user selects none to all criteria, the program will ask it to select at least each one and will loop back through the prompts.
